# Multilingual Emotion Detection in Voice

This project demonstrates how to detect emotions in speech across multiple languages using deep learning techniques. The notebook contains all the necessary code to preprocess voice data, extract features, train a model, and evaluate its performance on emotion classification tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook focuses on:

* Emotion recognition from speech signals
* Handling multilingual voice data
* Using machine learning/deep learning models for classification
* Audio preprocessing and feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs)

## 🧠 Model and Methodology

* **Feature Extraction**: MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
* **Model Architecture**: Likely CNN, LSTM, or MLP (details found in notebook)
* **Languages**: Multiple (languages supported are based on the dataset)
* **Dataset**: A voice/emotion dataset, possibly multilingual (e.g., RAVDESS, EMO-DB, or custom)

## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure the following packages are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas librosa matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the notebook cell-by-cell.
4. Follow the evaluation metrics to analyze model performance.

## 📈 Results

* Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, possibly F1 Score
* Visualization of loss and accuracy during training
* Sample audio classification results
